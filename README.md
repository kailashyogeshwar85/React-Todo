# React-Todo
A Simple Todo App to demonstrate how to create todoApp from scratch with separate file for all 
components. I have used semantic-ui-react for designing the components. I have kept the concept as simple as 
possible to understand the flow and updation of state and how props are updated as the todo example on Redux website
is a bit complex for beginner and who has not used all ES6 concepts.


## Pre-requisites
**Nodejs**  - v4.4.*
**Webpack** - v^1.4.0
**ReacJS**  - latest


## Usage
``` Javascript
npm install && npm start
```

Open your browser at http://localhost:4040 to play with the App.


**TODO**: 
-  To persist the todo data in MongoDB
-  Using async functions for making api request
-  Writing test cases
-  Using css for components
